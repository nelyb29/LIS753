    <h2>Come one, come all, come early!</h2>
    <p>We are open the last weekend of the month. The doors open at 8am until 2pm on Saturday and Sunday.

    <h2>Same Low Prices </h2>
    <p>You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we
have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we
give 100%. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people youâ€™ll ever
find. </p>
<p>On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select
no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to
pay for all your purchases. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and
exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and
reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line
remains outside.
</p>
<p>On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are
half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then
filling these with books. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour
earlier than the Main room on Saturday.
