    <h2>Over 50,000 items </h2>
    <p>We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our
monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We
also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new
purchases. </p>

  <h2>Great Bargains></h2>
<p>Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center. In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50

Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track,
Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including
picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs,
and books for parents and teachers.
Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50
cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents.
